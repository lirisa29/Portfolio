        <!-- Synopsis -->
        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            Depths of Decay puts you in the role of Sage Monroe, a marine biologist on a mission to restore polluted ocean environments. 
            Navigating fragile underwater habitats with limited oxygen and specialized tools, you must remove debris, manage resources carefully, and make strategic choices under pressure. 
            Each cleared area unlocks upgrades and more challenging zones, combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and strategy while revealing the hidden consequences of pollution beneath the waves.

        <!-- Project Brief -->
        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
            The project brief for Depths of Decay required designing a serious game for a non-profit organisation to raise awareness and educate young South Africans (18–30) about an important social or environmental issue. 
            The task involved researching the NPO and its target audience, generating insights, and proposing a game concept that emotionally connects players to the cause. 
            The game needed to demonstrate clear learning outcomes, engaging mechanics, and meaningful gameplay while reflecting the NPO’s mission. 
            After pitching the concept, a prototype had to be built in Unity to test the core gameplay, evaluate its fun factor and educational impact, and gather feedback to refine the experience based on playtesting results and observations.

        <!-- My Role -->
        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I took on a comprehensive role in both the technical and creative aspects of Depths of Decay. 
            I developed the core gameplay mechanics, including player controls, resource management, and a modular inventory system using Scriptable Objects, gaining valuable experience in scalable game architecture. 
            On the design side, I created all UI elements in Photoshop and produced a clickable Figma prototype to test and refine user experience. 
            I also contributed to animating the main character’s underwater movements, implemented parallax backgrounds to enhance visual depth, and designed tile-based maps in Unity for modular and expandable level layouts.
