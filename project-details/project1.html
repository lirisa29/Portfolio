        <!-- Synopsis -->
        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            The Great Banana Dash follows Kai, a rookie monkey racing through vibrant jungle tracks in a high-energy kart competition. 
            Facing off against crafty AI opponents, you’ll drift through tight corners, gather bananas, and unleash speed boosts to stay ahead. 
            Mastering the drift mechanic is key as you navigate lush environments, outmaneuver rivals, and push for victory in this fast-paced, banana-filled jungle showdown.

        <!-- Project Brief -->
        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
            This project required building a standalone 3D racing game in Unity that showcased advanced programming concepts and data-structure-driven systems. 
            The game features three racing modes—checkpoint time trials, an AI-driven beginner course, and a branching advanced race—each incrementally increasing in complexity. 
            Across the project, multiple custom data structures were implemented, including a Queue for dialogue sequencing, a Stack for checkpoint tracking, a LinkedList for AI waypoint navigation, and a Graph for handling branching race paths. 
            Additional requirements included designing a dialogue system with persistent storage, modeling tracks and baking navigation meshes, using the Factory pattern to generate diverse AI racers, and creating animated spectators driven by the State pattern. 
            Sound effects were later integrated through a custom HashMap, tying together a technically rich and fully functional racing experience.

        <!-- My Role -->
        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
        <p>
            For The Great Banana Dash, I served as the sole developer, responsible for both the technical and creative direction of the entire project. 
            I programmed all core gameplay systems—AI behaviour, race logic, data-structure-driven mechanics, and supporting tools—while also designing and building every map and track from scratch using Blender and Unity. 
            I handled all environment composition, custom lighting, and post-processing, crafting a cohesive visual style supported by skyboxes and UI elements I created in Photoshop alongside AI-assisted tools. 
            I also selected and integrated all music and sound effects from Pixabay, ensuring the audio matched the game’s pacing and atmosphere.
