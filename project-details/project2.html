        <!-- Synopsis -->
        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            Cyro Crisis places you aboard a malfunctioning spaceship overrun by deadly mutants, forcing you to fight for survival as a lone remaining crew member. 
            Armed with a range of sci-fi weapons, you’ll navigate dimly lit corridors, secure compromised areas, and battle back the spreading infestation before it’s too late. 
            Blending tense atmosphere with fast-paced combat, the game delivers a high-stakes sci-fi shooter experience as you struggle to contain the crisis threatening the entire ship.

        <!-- Project Brief -->
        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
            This project required building a single-player first-person deathmatch shooter in Unreal Engine, modeled after classic arena shooters like Quake 3 Arena, with a strong emphasis on applying SOLID principles and programming design patterns throughout the codebase. 
            In Part 1, the focus was on implementing player movement, two switchable firearms, and ammunition pickups. 
            Part 2 expanded the game with AI-controlled bots capable of navigating the arena, swapping weapons, and collecting ammo and health pickups just like the player. 
            Part 3 introduced a functional leaderboard, a title screen, and core UI elements for restarting or quitting matches, along with refactoring the existing systems using appropriate design patterns. 
            Across all stages, clean, modular, and maintainable architecture was the primary goal.
        </p>

        <!-- My Role -->
        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
        <p>
            For Cyro Crisis, I developed the entire game on my own, marking my first full project in Unreal Engine and my first time coding exclusively in C++. 
            I created the complete environment by modeling the arena in Blender and crafting custom lighting and UI elements, while focusing primarily on building solid gameplay systems. 
            I implemented a functional AI system from scratch—featuring enemy patrols, player detection, combat behaviour, weapon pickups, death, and respawning—which, despite some remaining challenges, taught me a great deal about Unreal’s AI tools and C++ workflow. 
            Throughout the project, I structured the codebase around SOLID principles and design patterns, using interfaces, abstraction, and patterns like Factory, Observer, and State to keep the architecture clean, modular, and easy to extend.
