        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            Monster Moto Rush throws players into a high-energy 2D motorcycle racing challenge powered by the bold style of Monster Energy. 
            You’ll race across rugged, neon-soaked tracks, pulling off stunts, landing jumps with precision, and chaining combos to rack up massive scores before time runs out. 
            With its fast pace, stylish visuals, and emphasis on skillful stunt riding, the game captures the adrenaline and attitude of the extreme racing world.

        <!-- Project Brief -->
        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
            This project required pitching, designing, and prototyping an advergame for a real-world brand—in this case, Monster Energy—by demonstrating how a game could strengthen the brand’s connection with its target audience. 
            The brief began with researching the brand’s identity, products, and demographic to justify why an advergame would be an effective marketing tool. 
            From there, the task involved proposing a game concept that aligned with the brand’s personality, player motivations, and core design principles, supported by mood boards and visual references. 
            After successfully pitching the idea, the next phase involved developing an alpha prototype featuring functional UI, sound, a gameplay guide or tutorial, and enough content to convey the intended experience. 
            In addition to the prototype, the project required creating a detailed gamification proposal for the brand’s digital presence—outlining mechanics, motivations, social media integration, ethical considerations, and measurable outcomes to help the marketing team envision how gamified systems could boost engagement beyond the game itself.

        <!-- My Role -->
        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
        <p>
            In Monster Moto Rush, I was responsible for designing and developing the game’s core systems and visual features, including a procedural terrain generation system that allowed each track to be dynamically created with unique layouts and difficulty levels. 
            I learned and applied Unity’s Shader Graph to craft animated fullscreen shaders that gave each level a distinctive, energetic atmosphere. 
            I also built the in-game store, enabling players to purchase and equip bike skins, and implemented full data persistence so progress, purchases, and customisation choices carry across sessions. 
            Alongside these technical features, I contributed to UI and UX design, ensuring that menus, interactions, and overall flow aligned smoothly with the game’s fast-paced, arcade-style experience.
